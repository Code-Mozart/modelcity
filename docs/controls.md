# Controls and features (^371)

**Status: the audit is in progress.** This file was started from blank on purpose; the previous reference is in the Git history (`git show origin/main:docs/controls.md`, last version before ^371). We fill the tables below one feature at a time, together, and take over everything from the old file that is still true. Until the PR of ^370 is merged, the old file stays the current reference.

## Definitions

- **Feature:** anything the app can do or show (a mode, a snap, a rendering, a measurement, an operation). Has a hat of type `feature`, or `operation` (see `docs/hats.md`; features and operations are listed there, not here).
- **Operation** (^180): a feature the user can do (add node, move node, split a segment, merge, delete). Every operation is a feature; not every feature is an operation (a snap rule, a gizmo, a label is not).
- **Control:** one input (key, button or gesture, with its modifiers) that does something *in a given context*. Controls are contextual by design (^45), so every row names its **context**: the mode (view, select, draw, extend), what is under the pointer, and the state of the app (selection, drag, being drawn, touch).
- **Hat:** reused if the feature, control or operation already has one (^371 rule 1); registered first if not.

## Columns

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Hat | The hat of the feature, control or operation. |
| Context | Mode, what is under the pointer, app state. |
| Control | The input, with modifiers. |
| Operation | What it does there. |
| Hint | The control hint (^181) it shows, or the recorded reason it has none (an exemption). |
| Visitable | Whether and how the hint can be visited (hovered or reached, ^259): yes (how), no (why). |
| Special behavior | Everything else that applies: toast message (^210), cursor, hides after use (^110), snapping, and so on. |
| Tests | Where it is tested: unit (one module), integration (the editor engine with a graph, no browser), e2e (the browser). |
